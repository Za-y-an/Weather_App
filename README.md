# weather_app

A new Flutter project about weather information of different cities.
For specific this project i took help from AI for front-end development so that i can learn how to make a full project as it was my first project.
I just remove the API key which was my personal API key (from Openweather website). By creating an API key of that website it can be use as a good and comfortable app.
